            I'm Michał, React Developer. Fresh out of college, but experienced,
            I am looking for an opportunity to further develop my skills in
            React and Frontend in general. I had the opportunity to take part in
            a student internship at a well-known international company as a
            front-end developer. During this time I managed to implement and
            deploy a crucial application in React. At my current position I work
            with JS everyday, implementing, debugging and consulting clients’
            custom solutions.

              I like to code things from scratch and love to see an idea
              becoming a live thing. Clean code and elegant design is my ninja
              way.

              I obtained my engineer degree in Control Engineering and Robotics
              but discovered that programming brings me tons of satisfaction and
              so obtained my master degree in Computer Science.

              I spend most of my spare time at shredding on my guitars (almost
              for 10 years now) and on many different sports (not pro at any of
              them but fun is fun).
